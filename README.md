# Drift Simulation

The drift simulation uses 3D [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to randomly generate a landscape of colors and shapes that evolves over time. This project is inspired by the [macOS Drift screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WXzRhebz1g&ab_channel=NobelTech). Each line's rotation, length, width, and color are derived from 3D Perlin noise implemented in the shaders.
